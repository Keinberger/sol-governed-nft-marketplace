/**
 * @title NftMarketplace
 * @author Philipp Keinberger
 * @notice This contract is an nft marketplace, where users can list (sell) and buy
 * nfts using eth and erc20 tokens. Payment tokens (e.g. erc20-tokens, accepted by
 * the marketplace as payment for nfts) can be added and removed through access-
 * restricted functions, favourably controlled by a governor contract (e.g. dao) to
 * allow for decentralized governance of the marketplace. The contract is designed
 * to be upgradeable.
 * @dev This contract implements the IERC721 and IERC20 Openzeppelin interfaces for the
 * ERC721 and ERC20 token standards.
 *
 * The Marketplace implements Chainlink price feeds to retrieve prices of listed erc20
 * payment tokens.
 *
 * This contract inherits from Openzeppelins OwnableUpgradeable contract in order to
 * allow owner features, while still keeping upgradeablity functionality. The
 * Marketplace is designed to be deployed through a proxy contract to allow for future
 * upgrades of the contract.
